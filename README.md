Telecom Customer Churn Analysis
Project Overview
This project analyzes customer churn data from a telecommunications company to understand the factors influencing customer retention and churn. The primary goal is to identify characteristics and behaviors associated with customer churn to inform strategies that can reduce it.

Dataset
The dataset contains information on 300 customers, including:

Demographic data (gender, age, etc.) <br>
Account information (tenure, contract type, payment method, etc.) <br>
Service details (Internet, Online Security, Tech Support, etc.) <br>
Monthly and Total Charges <br>
Churn status (indicating whether the customer has left the service) <br>
Analysis Steps
Data Exploration: Understanding data types, checking for missing values, and identifying unique values. <br>
Data Visualization: Exploring churn distribution based on customer attributes, including:
Monthly and Total Charges <br>
Tenure (length of service) <br>
Add-on services (Internet Service, Tech Support, etc.) <br>
Correlation Analysis: Examining relationships between numeric variables to identify potential factors influencing churn. <br>
Key Insights
Customers with higher monthly charges and shorter tenures are more likely to churn. <br>
Add-on services, such as Online Security and Tech Support, are associated with lower churn rates. <br>
Long-term customers are less likely to churn, suggesting loyalty builds over time. <br>
Conclusion
To reduce churn, the company should focus on improving early customer experiences, consider flexible pricing, and promote value-added services. Implementing loyalty programs for long-term customers and targeting at-risk customers with personalized retention strategies may also be effective.
