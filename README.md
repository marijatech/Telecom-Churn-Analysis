📊 Telecom Customer Churn Analysis

📝 Project Overview
This project analyzes customer churn data from a telecommunications company to understand the factors influencing customer retention and churn. The primary goal is to identify characteristics and behaviors associated with customer churn to inform strategies that can reduce it.

📂 Dataset
The dataset contains information on 300 customers, including:

🔹 Demographic data (gender, age, etc.) <br>

🔹 Service details (Internet, Online Security, Tech Support, etc.) <br>
🔹 Monthly and Total Charges <br>
🔹 Churn status (indicating whether the customer has left the service)
📊 Analysis Steps
🔍 Data Exploration: Understanding data types, checking for missing values, and identifying unique values. <br>
📈 Data Visualization: Exploring churn distribution based on customer attributes, including:
